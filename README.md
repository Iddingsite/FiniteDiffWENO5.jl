FiniteDiffWENO5.jl is a Julia package that implements a finite difference fifth order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) method on regular grids for advection terms in partial differential equations for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems. The current implementation is based on the WENO-Z scheme from [Borges et al. (2008)](10.1016/j.jcp.2007.11.038).

Currently, the package focuses on non-conservative form of the advection terms ($\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u$) on collocated grid, and conservative form ($\text{div}\right(\mathbf{v} u\left)$) on staggered grid with the advection velocity located on the sides of the cells. The time integration is performed using a third-order Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK3) method.

The core of the package is written in pure Julia, focusing on performance using CPUs but GPU support is available using KernelAbstractions.jl and Chmy.jl via an extension.

## Features

The package currently provides only two main functions: `WENOScheme()`, that is used to create a WENO scheme struct containing all the necessary information for the WENO method, and `WENO_step!()`, that performs one step of the time integration using the WENO-Z method and a 3rd-order Runge-Kutta method. The grid and the initial condition must be defined by the user.

## Example

To see more examples, refer to the folder examples or the test folder.
Here is a simple example of using the package to solve the 1D linear advection equation with periodic boundary conditions and classical initial conditions:

```julia
using FiniteDiffWENO5
using GLMakie

# Number of grid points
nx = 200

# domain size
x_min = -1.0
x_max = 1.0
Lx = x_max - x_min

x = range(x_min, stop = x_max, length = nx)

# Courant number
CFL = 0.4
period = 4

# Parameters for Shu test
z = -0.7
δ = 0.005
β = log(2) / (36 * δ^2)
a = 0.5
α = 10

# Functions
G(x, β, z) = exp.(-β .* (x .- z) .^ 2)
F(x, α, a) = sqrt.(max.(1 .- α^2 .* (x .- a) .^ 2, 0.0))

# Grid x assumed defined
u0_vec = zeros(length(x))

# Gaussian-like smooth bump at x in [-0.8, -0.6]
idx = (x .>= -0.8) .& (x .<= -0.6)
u0_vec[idx] .= (1 / 6) .* (G(x[idx], β, z - δ) .+ 4 .* G(x[idx], β, z) .+ G(x[idx], β, z + δ))

# Heaviside step at x in [-0.4, -0.2]
idx = (x .>= -0.4) .& (x .<= -0.2)
u0_vec[idx] .= 1.0

# Piecewise linear ramp at x in [0, 0.2]
# Triangular spike at x=0.1, base width 0.2
idx = abs.(x .- 0.1) .<= 0.1
u0_vec[idx] .= 1 .- 10 .* abs.(x[idx] .- 0.1)

# Elliptic/smooth bell at x in [0.4, 0.6]
idx = (x .>= 0.4) .& (x .<= 0.6)
u0_vec[idx] .= (1 / 6) .* (F(x[idx], α, a - δ) .+ 4 .* F(x[idx], α, a) .+ F(x[idx], α, a + δ))

u = copy(u0_vec)
# here we create a WENO scheme for staggered grid, boundary (2,2) means periodic BCs on both sides. 0 means homogeneous Neumann and 1 means homogeneous Dirichlet BCs. stag = true means that the advection velocity is defined on the sides of the cells and should be of size nx+1 compared to the scalar field u.
weno = WENOScheme(u; boundary = (2, 2), stag = true)

# advection velocity, here we use a constant velocity of 1.0.
# It should be provided as a NamedTuple
a = (; x = ones(nx + 1))

# grid size
Δx = x[2] - x[1]
Δt = CFL * Δx^(5 / 3)

tmax = period * (Lx + Δx) / maximum(abs.(a.x))

t = 0

# timeloop
while t < tmax
    # here, u is updated in place and contains the solution at the next time step after the call to WENO_step!
    WENO_step!(u, a, weno, Δt, Δx)

    t += Δt

    if t + Δt > tmax
        Δt = tmax - t
    end
end
```

Which produces the following result:
